        <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26175544/105646222-acac2400-5e96-11eb-86e2-a12ef70dbc8e.png" class="logosImage">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I joined Code Nation to gain more confidence in my coding skills and to learn even more about life as a
            developer.
            <br>
            <br>
            I had experience with C# and Swift prior to joining, having joined I have gained experience with JavaScript,
            HTML and had more experience with Swift.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have found the whole experience at Code Nation incredibly beneficial to me, giving me confidence in my
            work
            and introducing me to new ways of problem solving.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Why am I interested in coding and tech?</h4>
        <p>I've always had an avid interest in tech and a fascination on how things actually work 'under the hood'.
            <br>
            <br>
            As a hobby I wanted to create my own mobile game and looked at how I can viably make that happen, so I found
            the
            entry to the google play store being the most affordable and easiest in that sense. So I started with Unity
            and
            developed a basic 2D platformer. This was a deep dive into coding but I used online resources and videos
            available on YouTube to learn and achieve what I wanted.
            <br>
            <br>
            After this starting point I was 'hooked' and wanted to learn more, I wanted to learn enough to make a career
            as
            a developer.
            <br>
            <br>
            I started to develop iOS apps in Swift and add them to my GitHub to start a portfolio for myself, hopefully
            helping me to gain employment in the industry.
            <br>
            <br>
            I then undertook a software development apprenticeship which I passed and has lead me to a possible
            permanent
            job as a junior developer pending a trial period.</p>
        <br>

            <h4>"Describing the purpose of IT in modern business"</h4>
            <p>Modern businesses from multi-national corporations who maintain mainframe systems and databases to small
                businesses that own a single computer all rely on IT for fast communications, data processing and market
                intelligence. IT plays an integral role in every industry, helping companies improve business processes,
                achieve
                cost efficiencies, drive revenue growth and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace.
                <br>
                <br>
                Each business, regardless how big or small they are will benefit from IT and as a modern business they
                will
                need
                to utilise IT to be able to compete with other businesses.
                <br>
                A whole business can operate using IT which can be powerful to enable businesses to thrive without a
                physical
                location.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>"Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully"</h4>
            <p>Most digital projects are not an individual endeavour so a good use of collaborative tools would be
                needed to
                effectively work in a team and achieve shared goals. Also for this strong communication skills are
                needed in
                order to make sure everyone in the team is informed on the happenings of the project.
                <br>
                <br>
                The following skills will aid in making projects successful too, problem solving, attention to detail,
                strong
                organisational skills, ability to multitask and prioritise and finally being goal/results-driven.
                <br>
                <br>
                Planning out projects from inception to delivery is vital so everyone in the team can identify what they
                need to
                do and when they can expect each part to be done. The project manager would be able to track the
                progress of
                the
                project when the project is thoroughly planned, any roadblocks can be identified prior to starting the
                work
                and
                the plan can be adapted to the business needs to successfully conclude the project.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>"Plan and carry out tasks using IT"</h4>
            <p>I've made use of Trello which is a collaboration tool that organises your projects into boards. In one
                glance,
                Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process.
                <br>
                <br>
                Trello has helped me keep on top of the tasks I need to do, breaking down tasks into smaller components
                has
                made
                them easier to accomplish as I can focus on each one without being overwhelmed by the end goal.
                <br>
                <br>
                You can see my Trello board for this following the link below.</p>

            <h4>"Describe the risks that might impact digital projects"</h4>
            <p>Planning projects with potential risks in mind can help in handling scenarios that may occur.
                <br>
                <br>
                Below are a few examples of risk in digital projects that can lead to failure.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You could be working on a project for a significant amount of time then a new version of the target
                    platform
                    is released and the site you have in development doesn’t work properly on the new version.</li>
                <li>Halfway through your project, the company merges with another company and they have a very different
                    go-live
                    strategy.</li>
                <li>6 months or so into a website build project, a competitor releases a new site with a great new
                    feature
                    that
                    could draw your target customers away.</li>
                <li>A key member of the team departs your company for another opportunity elsewhere in the middle of the
                    project.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h4>"Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software"</h4>
            <p>In order to select the right kind of technology for the job, you would have to take into consideration
                key
                components of your project such as your target audience and which platforms they would reside on so you
                can
                plan
                and decide on the environment you will develop the project in.
                <br>
                <br>
                You would also need to consider the skills and knowledge of the team members to decide on which tools to
                use
                for
                the project.
                <br>
                <br>
                A business analyst would gather all the requirements for the project, this would determine things such
                as
                the
                target platform, desired features etc.
                From that you would select appropriate technologies to use to be able to successfully deliver the
                project.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>"Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes"
            </h4>
            <p>I have chosen to use Trello to help me organise my tasks. It has been extremely beneficial for me to
                visualise at
                a glance how my tasks are going, I can quickly see which tasks are done, still in progress and left to
                do.
                <br>
                <br>
                The tool is also built with collaboration in mind, knowing this I can easily utilise the same features
                on
                any
                future team projects.
                <br>
                <br>
                Having learnt about git and version control, I have used GitHub to host my repositories for my coding
                projects.
                This has enabled easy version control, so I can see a history of all the changes made to the code. I can
                also
                see how this will be of great use when working in a team, multiple developers can make changes to the
                same
                project and using version control you can do things such as branches, where someone could branch off to
                work
                on
                a particular feature and then once it is done they can merge it back to the master branch of the
                project.
                <br>
                <br>
                I've made use of Visual Studio Code to build the website with HTML content. Visual Studio Code also
                includes
                support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets,
                and
                code refactoring all features that help with my development flow.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>"Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects"</h4>
            <p>All digital projects have to adhere to the new regulations so projects will have to consider relevant
                constraints
                before undertaking the project and make sure they are within those guidelines throughout the project
                lifecycle.
                <br>
                <br>
                The GDPR is the EU’s way of giving individuals, prospects, customers, contractors and employees more
                power
                over
                their data and less power to the organisations that collect and use such data for monetary gain.
                <br>
                Under the GDPR individuals have the right to access, the right to be forgotten, the right to data
                portability,
                the right to be informed, the right to have information corrected, the right to restrict processing, the
                right
                to object and the right to be notified.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The right to access means that individuals have the right to request access to their personal data
                    and
                    to
                    ask how their data is used by the company after it has been gathered.
                    <br>
                    The company must provide a copy of the personal data, free of charge and in electronic format if
                    requested.
                </li>
                <li>The right to be forgotten means if consumers are no longer customers, or if they withdraw their
                    consent
                    from
                    a company to use their personal data, then they have the right to have their data deleted.</li>
                <li>The right to data portability means individuals have a right to transfer their data from one service
                    provider to another. And it must happen in a commonly used and machine readable format.</li>
                <li>The right to be informed means any gathering of data by companies, and individuals must be informed
                    before
                    data is gathered.
                    <br>
                    Consumers have to opt in for their data to be gathered, and consent must be freely given rather than
                    implied.
                </li>
                <li>The right to have information corrected means that individuals can have their data updated if it is
                    out
                    of
                    date or incomplete or incorrect.</li>
                <li>The right to restrict processing means individuals can request that their data is not used for
                    processing.
                    <br>
                    Their record can remain in place, but not be used.
                </li>
                <li>The right to object means individuals have the right to stop the processing of their data for direct
                    marketing.
                    <br>
                    There are no exemptions to this rule, and any processing must stop as soon as the request is
                    received.
                    <br>
                    In addition, this right must be made clear to individuals at the very start of any communication.
                </li>
                <li>The right to be notified means if there has been a data breach which compromises an individual’s
                    personal
                    data, the individual has a right to be informed within 72 hours of first having become aware of the
                    breach.

            <p>Although websites are not a kind of copyright work, their constituent elements are likely to be protected
                by
                copyright. Website text and code may be protected as literary works; photographs and other website
                artworks
                may
                be protected as artistic works; website music tracks may be protected both as musical works and through
                sound
                recording copyright. A single video clip can accommodate a profusion of different rights.
                <br>
                Simply cataloguing the different copyrights subsisting in a website can be a major undertaking.
                <br>
                <br>
                In English law, permissions to use copyright works also known as licences do not need to be in writing.
                For
                instance, when you make a website available to the world, you grant an implied licence to internet users
                to
                copy
                that website for the purpose of viewing it on a web browser. However, the exact scope of implied and
                unwritten
                licences may be unclear.
                <br>
                There is one exception to the above rule, statutory exclusive licences must be in writing signed by or
                on
                behalf
                of the copyright owner, as must transfers of copyright ownership.
                <br>
                <br>
                Organisation governance can constrain what can be implemented on a site, so being up to date on company
                guidelines can ensure the website is built in line with the company regulations.

                <br>
                The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)'s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is an effort to improve the
                accessibility of the World Wide Web (WWW or Web) for people with disabilities. People with disabilities
                may
                encounter difficulties when using computers generally, but also on the Web.
                <br>
                The principles of accessibility are as follows
                <ul>
                    <li>Perceivable</li>
                    <li>Operable</li>
                    <li>Understandable</li>
                    <li>Robust</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Considered aspects are as such, available through sight, hearing or touch. Compatible with keyboard or
                mouse.
                User-friendly, easy to comprehend. Works across devices, assistive technologies.
                <br>
                Two examples of key methods used when designing with accessibility in mind are as follows.
                <br>
                <br>
                Alternative Text (Alt Text)
                <br>
                Alternative text provides a textual alternative to non-text content in web pages. For example, an image
                may
                not
                be easily identifiable as to what the image presents so the alt text provides the user the content and
                function
                of the image.
                <br>
                <br>
                Functionality Available from Keyboard
                <br>
                Many people do not use the mouse and rely on the keyboard to interact with the Web. This requires
                keyboard
                access to all functionality, including form controls, input, and other user interface components. For
                example,
                all functionality that is available by mouse is also available by keyboard.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>"Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h4>
            <p>
                We use HTML, CSS & JavaScript to build websites as this is what browsers understand. This standardised
                approach allows your website to be viewable though various browsers.
                <br>
                <br>
                While downloading files and viewing websites, you’ll come across many file formats. Most are common, and
                encountered frequently, others are more obscure and require specialist programs to open or use.
                <br>
                <br>
                Here is a list of commonly found filetypes.
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>.AVI — Audio/Video Interleaved</li>
                    <li>.CSS — Cascading StyleSheet</li>
                    <li>.DOC — Microsoft Word DOCument</li>
                    <li>.EXE — EXEcutable file</li>
                    <li>.GIF — Graphics Interchange Format</li>
                    <li>.HTML/.HTM — HyperText Markup Language file</li>
                    <li>.JPG/.JPEG — Joint Photographic Experts Group file</li>
                    <li>.MID/.MIDI — Musical Instrument Digital Interface</li>
                    <li>.MP3 — MPEG Layer 3 sound file</li>
                    <li>.MPG/.MPEG — Motion Picture Experts Group file</li>
                    <li>.MOV/.QT — QuickTime MOVie</li>

            <h4>"Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you
                happy with the tools you used?"</h4>
            <p>I have been using tools such as Visual Studio Code, Trello and GitHub to help accomplish my outcomes.
                <br>
                <br>
                The tools have been extremely beneficial to my progress, for example I have been able to code HTML, CSS
                & JavaScript files all in the same environment using Visual Studio Code.
                <br>
                <br>
                Trello has also allowed me to plan and organise, my tasks letting me track where I'm up to and
                highlighting any tasks I have outstanding. This has been incredibly useful for me and I will continue to
                utilise the tool going forward.
                <br>
                <br>
                GitHub has allowed me to showcase my projects like a portfolio which is great for me to easily give
                future employers an insight to my skills.
                <br>
                It has also enabled me to keep track of my code changes, allowing for version control. This is vital
                when working in teams to make sure each change has accountability. This also means if you need to you
                can revert changes made, in addition with git we can branch out from the master branch to work on
                specific features and once completed we can merge back in to the master branch this kind of flexibility
                in use can allow for various styles of project completion.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>"Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate"</h4>
            <p>The tools I selected to use were appropriate for the goals I had.
                <br>
                They enabled me to accomplish everything I wanted with no issues to overcome, I will continue to use the
                selected tools and for similar projects I embark on in the future I would definitely consider using the
                same tools again.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>"Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project"</h4>
            <p>Assessing the final product from my website project, I am happy with the content and structure which
                follows a minimalistic aesthetic. Which I believe makes for an easier to digest website.
                <br>
                <br>
                The project outcomes have been delivered, and I've added some extra functionality to the site such as
                the navigation bar which allows the user to quickly go to the relevant sections.
                <br>
                In addition to this I have gone above and beyond to exceed the expectations of the project by using my
                knowledge in JavaScript I've added a button that appears when you scroll past the navigation bar, when
                clicked takes the user back to the top of the page.
                <br>
                This enables the user to quickly navigate to the top
                navigation bar when consuming the content further down the page.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>"Describe further improvements you can make to your project"</h4>
            <p>Going forward I can definitely make improvements to my project, I can use version control from the start
                and commit changes frequently to keep track of all the various stages of the project.
                <br>
                Whereas in this instance I have added the final build to GitHub.
                <br>
                <br>
                I can separate out my website into multiple pages to cut down on the amount of scrolling needed on a
                single page.
                <br>
                With this approach it would allow me to implement a landing page with links to the various sections
                which would comply with modern design guidelines for building a successful site.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>"Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose"</h4>
            <p>After reviewing all the outcomes I can confidently say I have fulfilled the requirements and that my
                final product is fit for purpose.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>"Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency"
            </h4>
            <p>The tools I used to help me complete the project were great to aid me in efficiently progressing with the
                tasks at hand, maintaining a high level productivity rate.
                <br>
                <br>
                I can see how the same tools would show even more efficiency when utilised in a team, I could have had
                the project done in a much quicker time period by delegating the tasks to different team members and the
                tools are built with collaboration in mind so many of the features in them allow for efficient team
                based project execution.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>"Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency"</h4>
            <p>In order to improve your productivity and be more efficient in your projects you can instill some of the
                following points:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Breakdown your goals into much smaller and easily attainable components.</li>
                <li>Plan your tasks with breaks in between them to keep you working at an optimal level.</li>
                <li>If you are working in a team, make sure to discuss each team members progression at frequent
                    intervals.
                    <br>
                    This allows everyone on the team to know where the project is at and how team members can
                    help with any roadblocks that may be present.</li>
                <li>Try to engage in regular team meetings to voice any concerns or to suggest any new ideas.</li>
                <li>Try to maintain a goal oriented approach.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h4>"Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects"</h4>
            <p>To enhance my abilities and improve my own productivity going forward in future projects, I would try to
                use my team work skills to achieve my goals in a team allowing for a much more dynamic approach to
                project execution.
                <br>
                <br>
                I would make use of collaborative tools such as Slack to keep the team engaged and allow for efficient
                team working.
                <br>
                I would suggest short daily meetings (daily scrums) to make sure each team member knows the goals for
                the day and how we can help each other to achieve those goals, overcoming any obstacles that may be
                present.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>"Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions"</h4>
            <p>I would implement TTD (Test Driven Development) so that tests are created simultaneously as the
                functional code. Allowing for comprehensive Unit Testing.
                <br>
                Unit Testing can be powerful when it comes to efficiently identifying defects in code, as each component
                has an appropriate test associated with it.
                <br>
                So you can pinpoint where issues are and in TTD you would suffice the test cases before finishing with
                the new code meaning as you develop you are passing the associated tests, ensuring your code is fit for
                purpose.
                <br>
                <br>
                I would also implement User Testing in my project, surveying a diverse user pool to gain knowledge on
                the use of my final product.
                <br>
                I would look for HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) improvements in my design and structure, to allow for
                a more engaging design.
                <br>
                I would also consider WAI (Web Accessibility Initiative) guidelines to ensure my website is accessible
                to a wider audience, enabling my website to be thoroughly inclusive.
